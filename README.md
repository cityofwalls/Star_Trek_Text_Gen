## Concepts covered
1) **Data cleaning**
--> Given complete production scripts for Star Trek: The Next Generation, separate lines into conversations between two target characters.
2) **Data Preprocessing**
--> Formulate these back and forth dialogues into input and output data for various NNs
3) **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
--> Given sequences of text (either at a letter/punctuation level or word level), predict a response.
4) **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**
--> Given some noise (a text prompt), generate a response.
