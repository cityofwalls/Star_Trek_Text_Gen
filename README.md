## Concepts covered
1) Data cleaning
/t- Given complete production scripts for Star Trek: The Next Generation, separate lines into conversations between two target characters.
2) Data Preprocessing
/t- Formulate these back and forth dialogues into input and output data for various NNs
3) Recurrent Neural Network
/t- Given sequences of text (either at a letter/punctuation level or word level), predict a response.
4) Generative Adversarial Network
/t- Given some noise (a text prompt), generate a response.
